Rework the previous problem so that a child is removed only on a composite (not prime) cycle 
(cycles start from 1)
If a cycle is prime, just print the child's name.
As before, print the name of the child that is left last.

Examples

```
Input	                Output
Mimi Pepi Toshko        Removed Pepi
2	                Prime Mimi
                        Prime Toshko
                        Removed Mimi
                        Last is Toshko
```
