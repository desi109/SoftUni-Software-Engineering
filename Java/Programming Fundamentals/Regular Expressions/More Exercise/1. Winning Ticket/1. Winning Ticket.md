## 1. Winning Ticket

Lottery is exciting. What is not, is checking a million tickets for winnings only by hand. So, you are given the task to create a program which automatically checks if a ticket is a winner. 
You are given a collection of tickets separated by commas and spaces. You need to check every one of them if it has a winning combination of symbols. A valid ticket should have exactly 20 characters. The winning symbols are '@', '#', '$' and '^'. But in order for a ticket to be a winner the symbol should uninterruptedly repeat for at least 6 times in both the tickets left half and the tickets right half. For example, a valid winning ticket should be something like this:  "Cash$$$$$$Ca$$$$$$sh". The left half "Cash$$$$$$" contains "$$$$$$", which is also contained in the tickets right half "Ca$$$$$$sh". A winning ticket should contain symbols repeating up to 10 times in both halves, which is considered a Jackpot (for example: "$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$").

Examples
```
Input	
Cash$$$$$$Ca$$$$$$sh	

Output
ticket "Cash$$$$$$Ca$$$$$$sh" - 6$
```
