## 2. Rage Quit 

Every gamer knows what rage-quitting means. It’s basically when you’re just not good enough and you blame everybody else for losing a game. You press the CAPS LOCK key on the keyboard and flood the chat with gibberish to show your frustration.
Chochko is a gamer, and a bad one at that. He asks for your help; he wants to be the most annoying kid in his team, so when he rage-quits he wants something truly spectacular. He’ll give you a series of strings followed by non-negative numbers, e.g. "a3"; you need to print on the console each string repeated N times; convert the letters to uppercase beforehand. In the example, you need to write back "AAA". 
On the output, print first a statistic of the number of unique symbols used (the casing of letters is irrelevant, meaning that 'a' and 'A' are the same); the format shoud be "Unique symbols used {0}". Then, print the rage message itself.
The strings and numbers will not be separated by anything. The input will always start with a string and for each string there will be a corresponding number. The entire input will be given on a single line; Chochko is too lazy to make your job easier.

Examples
```
Input		
a3	

Output
Unique symbols used: 1
AAA	

Comments
We have just one string-number pair. The symbol is 'a', convert it to uppercase and repeat 3 times: AAA.
Only one symbol is used ('A').
