## 05.	List Manipulation Advanced

Now we will implement more complicated list commands. Again, read a list, and until you receive "end" read commands: <br>
- Contains {number} – check if the list contains the number. If yes print "Yes", otherwise print "No such number".  
- Print even – print all the numbers that are even separated by a space.  
- Print odd – print all the numbers that are odd separated by a space.   
- Get sum – print the sum of all the numbers.  
- Filter ({condition} {number}) – print all the numbers that fulfill that condition. The condition will be either '<', '>', ">=", "<="

Example

```
Input	                          Output
2 13 43 876 342 23 543          No such number
Contains 100                    Yes
Contains 543                    2 876 342
Print even                      13 43 23 543
Print odd                       1842
Get sum                         43 876 342 543
Filter >= 43                    2	13 43 23
Filter < 100
end	
```
