## 03. Passed or Failed 

Modify the above program, so it will print "Failed!" if the grade is lower than 3.00.

Input<br>
The input comes as a single double number.

Output<br>
The output is either "Passed!" if the grade is more than 2.99, otherwise you should print "Failed!".

Examples

```
Input	      Output		
5.32	      Passed!

2.36	      Failed!
```

Hint<br>
We need to take floating-point number from the console. After that print in the else statement the appropriate message.
