## 05. Login

You will be given a string representing a username. The password will be that username reversed. Until you receive the correct password print on the console "Incorrect password. Try again.". When you receive the correct password print "User {username} logged in." However on the fourth try if the password is still not correct print "User {username} blocked!" and end the program.
