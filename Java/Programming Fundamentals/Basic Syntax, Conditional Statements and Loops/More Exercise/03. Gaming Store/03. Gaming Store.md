Write a program, which helps you buy the games. The valid games are the following games in this table:
```
Name	                          Price
OutFall 4	                  $39.99
CS: OG	                          $15.99
Zplinter Zell	                  $19.99
Honored 2	                  $59.99
RoverWatch	                  $29.99
RoverWatch Origins Edition	  $39.99
```
<br>
On the first line, you will receive your current balance – a floating-point number in the range [0.00…5000.00].
Until you receive the command “Game Time”, you have to keep buying games. When a game is bought, the user’s balance decreases by the price of the game.<br>
Additionally, the program should obey the following conditions:
- If a game the user is trying to buy is not present in the table above, print “Not Found” and read the next line.
- If at any point, the user has $0 left, print “Out of money!” and end the program.
- Alternatively, if the user is trying to buy a game which they can’t afford, print “Too Expensive” and read the next line.<br>
When you receive “Game Time”, print the user’s remaining money and total spent on games, rounded to the 2nd decimal place.
