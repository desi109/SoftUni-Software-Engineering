## 01. Data Types

Write a program that, depending on the first line of the input, reads an int, double or string.
- If the data type is int, multiply the number by 2.
- If the data type is real, multiply the number by 1.5 and format it to the second decimal point.
- If the data type is string, surround the input with "$".

Print the result on the console.

Examples
```
Input	  Output
int       10
5	

real      3.00
2	

string    $hello$
hello	
```
