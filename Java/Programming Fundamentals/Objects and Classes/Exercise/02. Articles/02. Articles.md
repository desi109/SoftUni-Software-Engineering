## 02.Articles

Create an article class with the following properties:  Title – a string,  Content – a string,  Author – a string.  The class should have a constructor and the following methods:  Edit (new content) – change the old content with the new one,  ChangeAuthor (new author) – change the author,  Rename (new title) – change the title of the article,  override ToString – print the article in the following format:  "{title} - {content}:{author}" .   Write a program that reads an article in the following format "{title}, {content}, {author}". On the next line, you will get a number n. On the next n lines, you will get one of the following commands: "Edit: {new content}"; "ChangeAuthor: {new author}"; "Rename: {new title}". At the end, print the final article.
