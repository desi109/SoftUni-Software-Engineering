## 06. Vehicle Catalogue


You have to make a catalogue for vehicles. You will receive two types of vehicle – car or truck. Until you receive the command “End” you will receive lines of input in the format:<br>
{typeOfVehicle} {model} {color} {horsepower}

After the “End” command, you will start receiving models of vehicles. Print for every received vehicle its data in the format:<br>
Type: {typeOfVehicle}<br>
Model: {modelOfVehicle}<br>
Color: {colorOfVehicle}<br>
Horsepower: {horsepowerOfVehicle}<br>
When you receive the command "Close the Catalogue", stop receiving input and print the average horsepower for the cars and for the trucks in the format:<br>
"{typeOfVehicles} have average horsepower of {averageHorsepower}." <br>
The average horsepower is calculated by dividing the sum of horsepower for all vehicles of the type by the total count of vehicles from the same type. Format the answer to the 2nd decimal point.
