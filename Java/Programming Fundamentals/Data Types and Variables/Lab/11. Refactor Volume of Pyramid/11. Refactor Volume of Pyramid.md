## 11. Refactor Volume of Pyramid

You are given a working code that finds the volume of a pyramid. However, you should consider that the variables exceed their optimum span and have improper naming. Also, search for variables that have multiple purpose.

Hints
- Reduce the span of the variables by declaring them in the moment they receive a value, not before
- Rename your variables to represent their real purpose (example: "dul" should become length, etc.)
- Search for variables that have multiple purpose. If you find any, introduce a new variable.
