## 01. Bank Account Test Client

Create a test client that tests your BankAccount class.<br>
Support the following commands:
- Create {Id}
- Deposit {Id} {Amount}
- Withdraw {Id} {Amount}
- Print {Id}
- End<br>
If you try to create an account with existing Id, print "Account already exists".
If you try to perform an operation on non-existing account with existing Id, print "Account does not exist".
If you try to withdraw an amount larger than the balance, print "Insufficient balance".
Print command should print "Account ID{id}, balance {balance}". Round the balance to the second digit after the decimal separator.

Examples
