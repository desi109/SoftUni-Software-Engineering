## 03. Generic Scale

Create a class Scale<T> that holds two elements - left and right. The scale should receive the elements through its single constructor:
- Scale(T left, T right)<br>
The scale should have a single method: 
- T getHeavier()<br>
The greater of the two elements is heavier. The method should return null if elements are equal.
